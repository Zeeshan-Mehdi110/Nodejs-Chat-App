# Chat App In Nodejs

This is a Chat App built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It utilizes socket.io for real-time communication and implements a RESTful API for server-client interactions.

## Installation

### Public Dependencies

To install the public dependencies, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies for the React client.

### Server Dependencies

Navigate to the server directory and run the following command to install the server dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Make sure to update the `.env` file located in the server directory. Set the value of the `mongodb` variable to your MongoDB connection URL.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the server directory:

```bash
yarn server
```

To start the React client, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
yarn start
```

The Chat Application should now be running successfully.
